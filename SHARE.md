Verification checklist

1. Open the GitHub Pages URL on a phone and confirm the page loads.
2. Paste the wa.me prefilled link into WhatsApp — it should open WhatsApp Web or the mobile app with the URL prefilled.
3. Optionally send the QR image to the recipient and have them scan it to open the page.

Notes

- If your page entry file is named `Sorry.html` instead of `index.html`, replace `index.html` in the fallback links with `Sorry.html` and use the Pages URL:

  https://adarsh41hub.github.io/Sorry-Card/Sorry.html

- If you want, I can add the QR PNG into the repo (or generate different sizes). Say "add QR" if you want me to create and commit the QR image file.
